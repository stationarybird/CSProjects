Word Search: Given an m by n grid of letters, and a list of words, find the location in the grid where the word can be found. A word matches a straight, contiguous line of letters in the grid. The match could either be done horizontally (left or right) or vertically (up or down). Initially we will not consider words that can be matched diagonally.

The format of the input file will be as follows: First line will have two integers - m, the number of lines in the grid and n, the number of characters in each line. The integers m and n will be separated by one or more spaces. There will be a single blank line. There will be m lines, where each line will have n characters, all in uppercase, separated by a space. There will be a single blank line. There will be a single integer k, denoting the number of words that follow. There will be k lines. Each line will contain a single word in all uppercase.

There will be k lines in your output. Each line will have the word that you were search for followed by true or false separated by one or more spaces. The boolean condition tells you if the word is in the file.

My program can find horizontal, vertical, and diagonal words.
